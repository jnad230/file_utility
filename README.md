# file_utility
Created a versatile 'File Utility' using C programming. The utility displayed the first 10 words of 'sample.txt' in the current directory, adapting to smaller files. Command-line support was added to specify alternate source files, granting users more control.

Additionally, the utility allowed content from the source file to be appended to a designated file using the '-a' argument. A customizable viewing/appending option using the '-n' argument was introduced, enhancing flexibility.

Provided users with seamless file manipulation and clear instructions through user documentation, showcasing strong C programming skills.
